Administrator notifications (Telegram, Viber)

Module for notifying administrators of the Opencart store (OcStore) about the new:
1) ordering
2) the buyer
3) partner
4) revocation
5) return

***Opportunities:***
1. Flexible, multilingual customization of the notification template
2. Flexible configuration of sending notifications for each administrator - for example, if you need to notify only one administrator about refunds, check only his box
3. Ability to customize notification for each of the order statuses
3. The ability to set logging of query errors (it is recommended to enable only at the testing stage)
4. Configuring actions for a long message (cut or split into several). Added due to limitation of character length in one message.
5. Ability to set a connection timeout (time in seconds to connect to servers). Added to prevent prolonged "freezing" during checkout, registration, etc. in case of unavailability of messenger servers.
